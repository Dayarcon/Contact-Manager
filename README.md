## üîß Google OAuth Configuration

### Setup Instructions

1. **Google Cloud Console Configuration**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google+ API and Google People API
   - Go to "Credentials" and create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for:
     - Android: Use package name `com.freefworlds.contactly`
     - iOS: Use bundle ID `com.freefworlds.contactly`
     - Web: Use redirect URI `https://auth.expo.io/@freefworlds/contactly`

2. **Client IDs**
   - Update the client IDs in `hooks/useGoogleAuth.ts` with your actual Google Cloud Console client IDs:
     - `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`: Your web client ID
     - `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`: Your iOS client ID

3. **Android Configuration**
   - Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` includes the Google Play Services dependency
   - The app uses `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` for native authentication

### Authentication Flow Fix

The app now properly handles Google OAuth authentication using the native Google Sign-In library with the following improvements:

- **Native Authentication**: Uses `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` for reliable native authentication
- **Success Callback**: Automatically navigates to home screen after successful authentication
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallback mechanisms
- **Token Management**: Secure token storage and automatic refresh
- **No Redirect Issues**: Native authentication eliminates redirect URI problems

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **Check Google Cloud Console**: Ensure all client IDs are properly configured
2. **Verify Client IDs**: Make sure the client IDs match your Google Cloud Console setup
3. **Check Network**: Ensure the device has internet connectivity
4. **Clear Cache**: Clear app cache and try again
5. **Check Play Services**: Ensure Google Play Services is available on Android devices

### Migration from expo-auth-session

The app has been migrated from `expo-auth-session` to `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` to resolve module compatibility issues and provide more reliable authentication.
